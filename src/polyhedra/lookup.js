/**
 * Rendering-path-only spec lookup that also knows about STAR_POLYHEDRA.
 * Deliberately separate from POLYHEDRA itself (index.ts) -- every attach/
 * build code path (ShapeViewer, PolyhedralWheel, core.ts's facesCongruent,
 * etc.) keeps reading POLYHEDRA directly and unchanged, so star polyhedra
 * stay structurally unreachable there. Only display components (preview
 * cards, the detail drawer, stats) need to resolve either registry, since
 * that's the one part of the app where these 4 solids ARE reachable (Full
 * Catalog's own reference-only section). See docs/star-polyhedra-spec.md.
