/**
 * Stage 7's D10<->D12 rewrite rule: when a node's shape changes, each of its
 * existing connections needs a vertex on the *new* shape that plays "roughly
 * the same role" as the vertex it used on the old shape. Both shapes are
 * centered at their own centroid, so a vertex's position doubles as its
 * outward direction — "same role" is approximated as "most similar outward
 * direction," matched 1:1 by a greedy best-score-first assignment. A ref
 * whose only candidates are below the threshold, or whose candidates all
 * lost the greedy race to a better-scoring ref, is left unmatched —
 * orphaned rather than guessed.
