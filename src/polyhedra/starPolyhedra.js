/**
 * The 4 Kepler-Poinsot solids (star polyhedra) -- BROWSABLE ONLY, never
 * merged into the main POLYHEDRA registry (index.ts), never a `FamilyKey`
 * in families.ts, never wired into any attach flow. See
 * docs/star-polyhedra-spec.md for the full staged plan and reasoning:
 * every face here is a genuine star or a shape whose OWN winding is
 * different from a convex polygon's, and the whole vertex/face-attach
 * engine (facesCongruent, vertex-capacity/hover, PolyhedralWheel's
 * family-driven picker) assumes convex, simple, non-self-intersecting
 * faces throughout. Kept structurally impossible to leak into that
 * system rather than filtered out ad hoc.
 *
 * Every one of the 4 is derived directly from this registry's own
 * already-validated DELTAHEDRA.D20 (icosahedron) or PLATONIC_ADDITIONS.
 * DODECAHEDRON vertex/edge/face data -- never hand-typed coordinates,
 * the same "derive, don't duplicate" standard every other family here
 * already holds itself to. Each construction was verified numerically
 * before being written here (real planarity/regularity/winding checks,
 * not assumed from memory) -- see this file's own comments at each step
 * for exactly what was checked, and docs/star-polyhedra-spec.md for the
 * summary table.
